# SOSC Website Project - Summary

## What We Built
We created a replica of the Sahyadri Open Source Community (SOSC) website that matches the design and functionality of their official site at sosc.org.in.

## Problems We Fixed

### 1. The 404 Error Problem
**What happened:** When we first ran the website, it showed a 404 error (page not found).

**Why it happened:** The home page file was missing, so when someone visited the website, there was nothing to show.

**How we fixed it:** We created the missing home page file and made sure the website properly redirects visitors to the home page.

---

### 2. Font Sizes Were Wrong
**What happened:** The text on the website was either too big or too small, and didn't match the original SOSC website.

**Why it happened:** The font sizes weren't standardized across different pages and components.

**How we fixed it:** We went through every page and component and set the correct font sizes:
- Main headings are now large and bold
- Regular text is readable and properly sized
- Everything matches the original SOSC website

---

### 3. Text Wasn't Aligned Properly
**What happened:** Text was scattered around the page instead of being neatly organized.

**Why it happened:** The alignment settings weren't consistent - some text was centered when it should be left-aligned, and vice versa.

**How we fixed it:** We fixed the alignment so:
- Headers are centered
- Content text is left-aligned
- Everything looks clean and organized like the original website

---

### 4. Events Couldn't Be Clicked
**What happened:** When users tried to click on event cards, nothing happened - they weren't interactive.

**Why it happened:** The event cards were just visual elements without any click functionality.

**How we fixed it:** We made the event cards clickable by adding:
- Click handlers so cards respond when clicked
- Hover effects so users know they can interact with them
- Visual feedback when hovering over events

---

### 5. Navigation Bar Issues
**What happened:** The navigation bar didn't show which page you were on, and the styling was inconsistent.

**Why it happened:** There was no way to highlight the current page, and the spacing and sizes weren't consistent.

**How we fixed it:** We improved the navigation by:
- Adding an underline to show which page you're currently viewing
- Making the logo clickable to go back home
- Fixing spacing and font sizes to match the original design

---

### 6. Website Didn't Work Well on Phones
**What happened:** The website looked broken or hard to use on mobile phones and tablets.

**Why it happened:** The layout wasn't responsive - it was designed only for desktop computers.

**How we fixed it:** We made the website responsive by:
- Making text and images scale properly on smaller screens
- Adjusting layouts so they work on phones, tablets, and computers
- Ensuring everything looks good on any device

---

## What We Changed Overall

**Before:** The website had errors, inconsistent styling, and missing functionality.

**After:** The website now:
- ✅ Works without any errors
- ✅ Looks exactly like the SOSC website
- ✅ Has proper font sizes and text alignment
- ✅ Has clickable, interactive events
- ✅ Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers
- ✅ Has a clean, professional appearance

---

## The Result

We successfully built a fully functional replica of the SOSC website that matches their design and provides a great user experience. All the problems have been fixed, and the website is ready to use!
